This file was compiled from the onnx-ml.proto file in ONNX v1.17.0 using protoc 4.29.3.

The protoc command was:
```shell
protoc --proto_path=../onnx/onnx --java_out=cr-examples/onnx/src/test/java/ ../onnx/onnx/onnx-ml.proto
```
executed from the root of the Babylon repo, assuming onnx is checked out in a sibling directory.
