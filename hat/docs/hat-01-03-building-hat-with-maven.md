# Building HAT

We can build HAT using maven and cmake.

Maven controls the build but delegates to cmake for native artifacts (such as various backends).

Note: You should not edit the pom.xml files, these are autogenerated (using mkpoms) and your changes will get overwritten.


## Setting environment variables JAVA_HOME and PATH

To build HAT we need to ensure that `JAVA_HOME` is set
to point to our babylon jdk (the one we built [here](hat-01-02-building-babylon.md))

It will simplify our tasks going forward if we add `${JAVA_HOME}/bin` to our PATH (before any other JAVA installs).

The `env.bash` shell script can be sourced (dot included) in your shell to set JAVA_HOME and PATH

It should detect the arch type (AARCH64 or X86_46) and select the correct relative parent dir and inject that dir in your PATH.

You will need jextract for your platform, and the jextract/bin dir should also be in your path.


```bash
cd hat
. ./env.bash
export PATH=${PATH}:/path/to/my/jextract/bin
echo ${JAVA_HOME}
/Users/ME/github/babylon/hat/../build/macosx-aarch64-server-release/jdk
echo ${PATH}
/Users/ME/github/babylon/hat/../build/macosx-aarch64-server-release/jdk/bin:/usr/local/bin:......
```

## Root level maven pom.xml properties

If you followed the instructions for building babylon your `pom.xml`
properties should look like this, and should not need changing

```xml
<project>
    <!-- yada -->
    <properties>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
        <hat.build>${env.PWD}/build</hat.build>
    </properties>
    <!-- yada -->
</project>
```
## Sanity checking your env and root pom.xml

After sourcing `env.bash` or making changes to `pom.xml` we can
sanity check our setup by running

```bash
cd hat
java @bldr/sanity
```

## Building with maven

Now we should be able to use maven to build, if successful maven will place all jars and libs in a newly created `build` dir in your top level hat dir.

```bash
cd hat
. ./env.bash
mvn clean  compile jar:jar install
ls build
hat-1.0.jar                         hat-example-heal-1.0.jar        libptx_backend.dylib
hat-backend-ffi-cuda-1.0.jar        hat-example-mandel-1.0.jar      libspirv_backend.dylib
hat-backend-ffi-mock-1.0.jar        hat-example-squares-1.0.jar     mock_info
hat-backend-ffi-opencl-1.0.jar      hat-example-view-1.0.jar        opencl_info
hat-backend-ffi-ptx-1.0.jar         hat-example-violajones-1.0.jar  ptx_info
hat-backend-ffi-spirv-1.0.jar       libmock_backend.dylib           spirv_info
hat-example-experiments-1.0.jar     libopencl_backend.dylib
```

The provided `maven-build.bash` script contains the minimal maven commandline

```bash
bash maven-build.bash
```

## Running an example

To run an example we use the maven artifacts in `build`

```bash
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java \
   --enable-preview --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED \
   --class-path build/hat-1.0.jar:build/hat-example-mandel-1.0.jar:build/hat-backend-ffi-opencl-1.0.jar \
   --add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal=ALL-UNNAMED \
   -Djava.library.path=build\
   mandel.Main
```

The provided `hatrun` java launch script simplifies this somewhat, we just need to pass the backend name `ffi-opencl` and the package name `mandel`
(all examples are assumed to be in `packagename/Main.java`

```bash
java @bldr/hatrun ffi-opencl mandel
```
