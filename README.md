## Particulars related to Babylon

The Babylon JDK builds like any other JDK, see the build instructions above.

### Code shared between `java.base` and `jdk.compiler` modules

A subset of code in `java.base` is copied with package renaming into
the `jdk.compiler` module. This is the set of code required to build
and serialize code models. Due to bootstrapping constraints, compiling
the compiler it cannot depend on all code in `java.base`. In the future
we may come up with a better solution. For now the build has been modified
to copy the code, which leverages the script `cr-util/copy-to-compiler.sh`.

### Testing

Specific compiler tests can be executed using `jtreg`, for example:

```
jtreg -jdk:./build/macosx-x86_64-server-release/jdk/ -ea -esa -avm -va test/langtools/tools/javac/reflect/
```

Specific runtime tests can be executed using `jtreg`, for example:

```
jtreg -jdk:./build/macosx-x86_64-server-release/jdk/ -ea -esa -avm -va test/jdk/java/lang/reflect/code/
```

In addition, the runtime tests can be executed using make with the test group
`jdk_lang_reflect_code` as follows:

```
make test TEST=jdk_lang_reflect_code
```
